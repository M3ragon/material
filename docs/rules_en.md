# General word

Welcome to the server 'Sugar and Salt'
We, the server team, welcome you to our server. In order for us all to be able to play in a certain harmony on the server, unfortunately there must be a certain set of rules.
Since we have several streamers on our server, this set of rules unfortunately has to be somewhat tightened. We ask for your understanding!

## General Behavior

- Don't be an idiot, but above all don't be an asshole! Always be fair to other players.
- Insults, racist and sexist statements will not be tolerated.
- Always treats each player with respect
- In support cases, try to always have a video proof ready. This is an advantage to better understand situations in support.
(Consider we are usually not on site)
- Support matters are only handled in Discord!
- Playing music in Voice, is prohibited
- Streaming nipping,from any streamer, is prohibited
- The exploitation of grey areas in the rules and regulations is also punished.

## KoS / PvP

- The unnecessary killing of Bambie's is to be avoided.
(If you run into an active fight as a bambie, you should be aware that you lose your bambie status)
- Exaggerated camping should be avoided.
- Combat logging is prohibited.

## Safezone

- Looting of other players (dead or alive) is prohibited.
- Looting and stealing of vehicles is prohibited.
- Taking advantage of the Safezone to avoid a fight is prohibited.

## Teams and alliances

- Maximum team size: 5 players.
- Alliances (building together) are not tolerated on the server, a non-attack pact is allowed. (Roaming/looting from different bases is allowed as long as the group size is not exceeded, but raiding is not allowed).
- Raiding with more than one group, aka Alliance, is therefore to be omitted. This applies to both sides (Raider and Geraidete)

## Vehicles

- If possible, park vehicles in the open air and not on lootspawn positions, otherwise there is a risk that they will despawn!
- Each base may have a maximum of 2 vehicles.
- No support for vehicles, unless a game recording is available.

## Bases

- Building bases near the Safezone (distance 1km), Trader(1km), Military(1km) and other player bases (distance 800m) is not allowed.
- With a base, a maximum of 3 floors are allowed. (This also excludes, the bases are built on e.b buildings. Building a roof terrace is allowed)
- Each team may only have onebase/territory.
- Bridges, tunnels, island crossings, industrial and military areas must be kept free at all times.
- Moving the flag for larger building areas is prohibited. However, vertical modification (upwards) is allowed to secure the flag.

## Raiding

- Entering / looting unlocked bases counts as a passive raid, so the raid rules apply.
- Unlocked bases are those that can be entered without forceful intrusion (e.B. blasting, glitch / bugusing, boosting or means of transport).
- Any items that are inside a broken or unlocked base may be shipped.
- Destroying (e.B. pushing Despawn) of unnecessary, portable or unreachable items (including vehicles) during a raid is to be avoided! (Please don't overdo it with looting and leave people with something left).
- The taking over of a foreign base is not permitted. Destroying the flag is allowed.

## Bug abuse

- The exploitation of game, mod and other bugs/bugs is prohibited.
- Looting through walls is prohibited
- Boosting with more than 2 people is considered a bug abuse!
